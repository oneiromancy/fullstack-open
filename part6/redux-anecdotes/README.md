### 6.3: anecdotes, step1

Implement the functionality for voting anecdotes. The amount of votes must be saved to a Redux-store.

### 6.4: anecdotes, step2

Implement the functionality for adding new anecdotes.

You can keep the form uncontrolled, like we did earlier.

### 6.5\*: anecdotes, step3

Make sure that the anecdotes are ordered by the number of votes.

### 6.6: anecdotes, step4

If you haven't done so already, separate the creation of action-objects to action creator-functions and place them in the src/reducers/anecdoteReducer.js file, so do like we have been doing since the chapter action creators.

### 6.7: anecdotes, step5

Separate the creation of new anecdotes into its own component called AnecdoteForm. Move all logic for creating a new anecdote into this new component.

### 6.8: anecdotes, step6

Separate the rendering of the anecdote list into its own component called AnecdoteList. Move all logic related to voting for an anecdote to this new component.

Now the App component should look like this:

```
import React from 'react'
import AnecdoteForm from './components/AnecdoteForm'
import AnecdoteList from './components/AnecdoteList'

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Anecdotes</h2>
      <AnecdoteForm />
      <AnecdoteList  />
    </div>
  )
}

export default App
```

### 6.9 Better anecdotes, step7

Start using React dev tools. Move defining the Redux-store into its own file store.js.

### 6.10 Better anecdotes, step8

The application has a ready-made body for the Notification component:

```
import React from 'react'

const Notification = () => {
  const style = {
    border: 'solid',
    padding: 10,
    borderWidth: 1
  }
  return (
    <div style={style}>
      render here notification...
    </div>
  )
}

export default Notification
```

Extend the component so that it renders the message stored in the redux store, making the component to take the form:

```
import React from 'react'
import { useSelector } from 'react-redux'

const Notification = () => {
  const notification = useSelector(/* something here */)
  const style = {
    border: 'solid',
    padding: 10,
    borderWidth: 1
  }
  return (
    <div style={style}>
      {notification}
    </div>
  )
}
```

You will have to make changes to the application's existing reducer. Create a separate reducer for the new functionality and refactor the application so that it uses a combined reducer as shown in this part of the course material.

The application does not have to use the Notification component in any intelligent way at this point in the exercises. It is enough for the application to display the initial value set for the message in the notificationReducer.

### 6.11 Better anecdotes, step9

Extend the application so that it uses the Notification component to display a message for the duration of five seconds when the user votes for an anecdote or creates a new anecdote:

It's recommended to create separate action creators for setting and removing notifications.

### 6.12\* Better anecdotes, step10

Implement filtering for the anecdotes that are displayed to the user.

Store the state of the filter in the redux store. It is recommended to create a new reducer and action creators for this purpose.

Create a new Filter component for displaying the filter. You can use the following code as a template for the component:

```
import React from 'react'

const Filter = () => {
  const handleChange = (event) => {
    // input-field value is in variable event.target.value
  }
  const style = {
    marginBottom: 10
  }

  return (
    <div style={style}>
      filter <input onChange={handleChange} />
    </div>
  )
}

export default Filter
```

### 6.13 Anecdotes and the backend, step1

When the application launches, fetch the anecdotes from the backend implemented using json-server.

As the initial backend data, you can use, e.g. this.

### 6.14 Anecdotes and the backend, step2

Modify the creation of new anecdotes, such that the anecdotes are stored in the backend.

### 6.15 Anecdotes and the backend, step3

Modify the initialization of redux-store to happen using asynchronous action creators, which are made possible by the redux-thunk-library.

### 6.16 Anecdotes and the backend, step4

Also modify the creation of a new anecdote to happen using asynchronous action creators, made possible by the redux-thunk-library.

### 6.17 Anecdotes and the backend, step5

Voting does not yet save changes to the backend. Fix the situation with the help of the redux-thunk-library.

### 6.18 Anecdotes and the backend, step6

The creation of notifications is still a bit tedious, since one has to do two actions and use the setTimeout function:

```
dispatch(setNotification(`new anecdote '${content}'`))
setTimeout(() => {
  dispatch(clearNotification())
}, 5000)
```

Make an asynchronous action creator, which enables one to provide the notification as follows:

```
dispatch(setNotification(`you voted '${anecdote.content}'`, 10))
```

the first parameter is the text to be rendered and the second parameter is the time to display the notification given in seconds.

Implement the use of this improved notification in your application.

### 6.19 anecdotes and connect, step1

The redux store is currently passed to all of the components through props.

Add the react-redux package to your application, and modify the AnecdoteList so that it accesses the store's state with the help of the connect function.

Voting for and creating new anecdotes does not need to work after this exercise.

The mapStateToProps function you will need in this exercise is approximately the following:

```
const mapStateToProps = (state) => {
  // sometimes it is useful to console log from mapStateToProps
  console.log(state)
  return {
    anecdotes: state.anecdotes,
    filter: state.filter
  }
}
```

### 6.20 anecdotes and connect, step2

Do the same for the Filter and AnecdoteForm components.

### 6.21 anecdotes, the grand finale

You (probably) have one nasty bug in your application. If the user clicks the vote button multiple times in a row, the notification is displayed funnily. For example if a user votes twice in three seconds, the last notification is only displayed for two seconds (assuming the notification is normally shown for 5 seconds). This happens because removing the first notification accidentally removes the second notification.

Fix the bug so that after multiple votes in a row, the notification for the last vote is displayed for five seconds. This can be done by cancelling the removal of the previous notification when a new notification is displayed whenever necessary. The documentation for the setTimeout function might also be useful for this.
