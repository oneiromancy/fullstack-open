# Bloglist Project

### 5.1: bloglist frontend, step1

Implement login functionality to the frontend. The token returned with a successful login is saved to the application's state user.

If a user is not logged-in, only the login form is visible.

If user is logged-in, the name of the user and a list of blogs is shown.

User details of the logged-in user do not have to be saved to the local storage yet.

NB You can implement the conditional rendering of the login form like this for example:

```
  if (user === null) {
    return (
      <div>
        <h2>Log in to application</h2>
        <form>
          //...
        </form>
      </div>
    )
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>blogs</h2>
      {blogs.map(blog =>
        <Blog key={blog.id} blog={blog} />
      )}
    </div>
  )
}
```

### 5.2: bloglist frontend, step2

Make the login 'permanent' by using the local storage. Also implement a way to log out.

Ensure the browser does not remember the details of the user after logging out.

### 5.3: bloglist frontend, step3

Expand your application to allow a logged-in user to add new blogs:

### 5.4\*: bloglist frontend, step4

Implement notifications which inform the user about successful and unsuccessful operations at the top of the page. For example, when a new blog is added, the following notification can be shown:

The notifications must be visible for a few seconds. It is not compulsory to add colors.

### 5.5 Blog list frontend, step5

Change the form for creating blog posts so that it is only displayed when appropriate. Use functionality similar to what was shown earlier in this part of the course material. If you wish to do so, you can use the Togglable component defined in part 5.

By default the form is not visible

It expands when button new note is clicked

The form closes when a new blog is created.

### 5.6 Blog list frontend, step6

Separate the form for creating a new blog into its own component (if you have not already done so), and move all the states required for creating a new blog to this component.

The component must work like the NewNote component from the material of this part.

### 5.7\* Blog list frontend, step7

Let's add each blog a button, which controls if all of the details about the blog are shown or not.

Full details of the blog open when the button is clicked.

And the details are hidden when the button is clicked again.

At this point the like button does not need to do anything.

The application shown in the picture has a bit of additional CSS to improve its appearance.

It is easy to add styles to the application as shown in part 2 using inline styles:

```
const Blog = ({ blog }) => {
  const blogStyle = {
    paddingTop: 10,
    paddingLeft: 2,
    border: 'solid',
    borderWidth: 1,
    marginBottom: 5
  }

  return (
    <div style={blogStyle}>
      <div>
        {blog.title} {blog.author}
      </div>
      // ...
  </div>
)}
```

NB: even though the functionality implemented in this part is almost identical to the functionality provided by the Togglable component, the component can not be used directly to achieve the desired behavior. The easiest solution will be to add state to the blog post that controls the displayed form of the blog post.

### 5.8\*: Blog list frontend, step8

Implement the functionality for the like button. Likes are increased by making an HTTP PUT request to the unique address of the blog post in the backend.

Since the backend operation replaces the entire blog post, you will have to send all of its fields in the request body. If you wanted to add a like to the following blog post:

```
{
  _id: "5a43fde2cbd20b12a2c34e91",
  user: {
    _id: "5a43e6b6c37f3d065eaaa581",
    username: "mluukkai",
    name: "Matti Luukkainen"
  },
  likes: 0,
  author: "Joel Spolsky",
  title: "The Joel Test: 12 Steps to Better Code",
  url: "https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/08/09/the-joel-test-12-steps-to-better-code/"
},
```

You would have to make an HTTP PUT request to the address /api/blogs/5a43fde2cbd20b12a2c34e91 with the following request data:

```
{
  user: "5a43e6b6c37f3d065eaaa581",
  likes: 1,
  author: "Joel Spolsky",
  title: "The Joel Test: 12 Steps to Better Code",
  url: "https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/08/09/the-joel-test-12-steps-to-better-code/"
}
```

One last warning: if you notice that you are using async/await and the then-method in the same code, it is almost certain that you are doing something wrong. Stick to using one or the other, and never use both at the same time "just in case".

### 5.9\*: Blog list frontend, step9

Modify the application to list the blog posts by the number of likes. Sorting the blog posts can be done with the array sort method.

### 5.10\*: Blog list frontend, step10

Add a new button for deleting blog posts. Also implement the logic for deleting blog posts in the backend.

Your application could look something like this:

The confirmation dialog for deleting a blog post is easy to implement with the window.confirm function.

Show the button for deleting a blog post only if the blog post was added by the user.

### 5.11: Blog list frontend, step11

Define PropTypes for one of the components of your application.

### 5.12: Blog list frontend, step12

Add ESlint to the project. Define the configuration according to your liking. Fix all of the linter errors.

Create-react-app has installed ESlint to the project by default, so all that's left for you to do is to define your desired configuration in the .eslintrc.js file.

NB: do not run the eslint --init command. It will install the latest version of ESlint that is not compatible with the configuration file created by create-react-app!

### 5.13: Blog list tests, step1

Make a test which checks that the component displaying a blog renders the blog's title and author, but does not render its url or number of likes by default

Add CSS-classes to the component to help the testing as necessary.

### 5.14: Blog list tests, step2

Make a test which checks that blog's url and number of likes are shown when the button controlling the shown details has been clicked.

### 5.15: Blog list tests, step3

Make a test which ensures that if the like button is clicked twice, the event handler the component received as props is called twice.

### 5.16\*: Blog list tests, step4

Make a test for the new blog form. The test should check, that the form calls the event handler it received as props with the right details when a new blog is called.

If, for example, you give an input element id 'author':

```
<input
  id='author'
  value={author}
  onChange={() => {}}
/>
```

You can access the contents of the field with

```
const author = component.container.querySelector('#author')
```
